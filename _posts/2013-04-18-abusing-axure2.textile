Welcome back to the Abusing Axure series.

Axure can be used from the most basic layout designs to very complex (probably overly complex and over-designed) prototypes. That's what makes Axure fun. This series explores the various ways one could over-engineer Axure.

Parallax is a popular new web design fad. Though it's a newcomer to the web world (a year or two from now it'll probably regarded as the Web 2.0 glossy button fad of yesteryear), it's still yet to peak as a web design trick. Although it's not as vague as it used to be (back when I developed this Axure trick), some clients still need to be shown how things behave.

That's where this Parallax Axure trick comes in.
