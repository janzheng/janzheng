Using Github pages is incredibly flexible and incredibly free. 

considered using Tumblr, hosting on dropbox (which is what I used to do), Light CMS, Squarespace, and a bunch of other CMS's.

Github and Jekyll beats them all in terms of cost (free) and flexibility (completely customizable) 

Probably more geared towards developers, as you need Ruby, and need to configure your own template / site for fancier (esp. responsive) designs.
