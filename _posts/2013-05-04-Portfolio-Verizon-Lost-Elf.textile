p. 
We wanted to create something for "Verizon Wireless":http://www.verizonwireless.com/ for the holidays that didn't involve selling more phones. The app was designed with families with young children in mind, and tied into the 2011 Holiday sales campaign.

p. 
* Created holiday and storybook app download flow
* Designed app functionality flow and experience
* Storyboarding and narrative integration
* Worked closely with designers and developers to integrate story with interface
