Wearable: 
"Just because we can..."

Intel: in ten years, computers will be in everything, and in every wear. Add meaning, and personalize



===============
"Intel TED talk Steve Brown":http://www.ted.com/pages/intel_steve_brown

1. 5th dimension: data
- Adding a "Data" dimension to objects, so they can be used to provide serendipitous services
- share scarce, important, expensive resources
- turn things into services for sustainability

2. Experiences
- Needs:
	- Feel connected to each other
	- Creative expression
	- be entertained
	- learn & grow
	- get things done
	- wellness

Intel Wearable's "perspective":http://www.techradar.com/us/news/portable-devices/intel-wearable-technology-is-failing-because-it-s-not-doing-enough-1234806
- it's about the services we wrap around the device
- what does it do to our lives, to improve it?
- Intel: An example he gave was a wearable device that would allow a parent to remotely monitor the health of a sleeping baby and would automatically send a signal to a kitchen device to warm some milk if needed.

Links & products of Current State / Cur Gen
- still not very consumer-friendly
- reminiscent of 1980s Apple IIc computers and Ataris
- hobby devices on the cusp of entering mainstream

- how many ways can you track your workout, calories, duration, display phone calls, texts, and social media alerts?
- how do all these new products actually set each other apart? Why choose one over the other? 

- industry applications, warehouse work, medical, food, life-tracking and saving etc.
