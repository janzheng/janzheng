      The Lost Elf Holiday Storybook app was created to promote Verizon as more than just another technology company. This was an exciting project we had full creative control without having to consider selling products.

      Each story had a fair amount of character customization, where players could choose colors of certain parts of their main character.

We wanted to create something for [Verizon Wireless](http://www.verizonwireless.com/) for the holidays that didn't involve selling more phones. The app was designed with families with young children in mind, and tied into the 2011 Holiday sales campaign.

* Created holiday and storybook app download flow
* Designed app functionality flow and experience
* Storyboarding and narrative integration
* Worked closely with designers and developers to integrate story with interface
