         <p class="flex-caption">Although the upower fitness layout and information architecture was very simple and flat, the site requires a strong story and hook to interest viewers. The result is a one-page layout that tells one consistent narrative.</p>

p. 
"upower fitness":http://www.upowerfitness.com/ is a small startup personal training and gym concept that recently opened up on the edge of Piedmont Park in Atlanta, GA.

The client wanted an online presence for their gym, which targets the more upscale audience of Midtown Atlanta. The gym focuses heavily on personal training, diet, and lifestyle management for its clientele. As such, the site needed to reflect the upscale nature of the business with a simple and elegant design.

Many similar workout, sports, or gym websites tend to be very noisy, so instead of using many gym sites as a foundation, I drew inspiration from the likes of Nike.com, upscale product, architecture, and startup websites. The result is something very simple, more akin to a new startup service than a gym concept. 

The story is also very simple, as the goal of the site is to bring more conversion to the gym. Since personal training makes up the majority of the business of upower, the site aims to establish the connection between the client and the owner, either by enticing the viewer to visit the location or to call the establishment. 

Future phases include integration with mindbodyonline or a similar sign-up service, depending on growth of the gym.

The site is created with the help of Jekyll and is hosted on Github. "The repository may be accessed here":https://github.com/janzheng/upowerfitness.
