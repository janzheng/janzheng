## A World of Bookmark Managers

There are probably more bookmark managers out there than we really need. I'm a former Delicious user and I've been using [Diigo](http://diigo.com) for a few years, and it works fairly well. I also use Chrome, and I like the way Google synchronizes my bookmarks across all my devices.

Yes, they work fairly well, but I have the same problem for both of these apps – I use bookmarks in two different ways, and they only solve for one. Here's a quick analogy: 



### Storage Closet

My closet is a semi-messy affair of clothing articles, loosely organized for different situations (cool tees in one corner; sport jackets in another; my tie collection in a third). The closet is there for me, close to where I sleep, but I still end up wearing the same things every day. I only go in there if you need to find a specific outfit. And sometimes, outfits will go forgotten for a very long time.

My closet never inspires me to wear something different, because its contents are tucked away behind a door. They're out of sight, out of mind, and I end up forgetting about them.



### Coffee Table

Meanwhile, the coffee table is always in the open. It's always in the corner of my eyes, at the edge of my mind. When I get bored, I mindlessly pick up a coffee table book. Maybe I'll learn something.

When friends come visit, it could even spark ideas and conversation.


### Bookmark Storage

Both Diigo and Chrome organizes bookrmarks in the same way – they let me throw your bookmarks in a digital storage closet. Sometimes I remember to go in there and take a look, but honestly there's so much cool stuff out there I become a hoarder of bookmarks, many of which I'll forget.

### Coffee Table of Bookmarks

What I need is a coffee table for bookmarks. A place for me to save my reading for later, for those days I get bored, or seeking inspiration.

This is where the power of [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) comes in. With Tumblr, you can easily post links, images, videos, and whatever you'd like to Tumblr, then display the content anywhere you'd like. 

Since I don't intend to use tumblr as a blog, I'm just using a janky bare bones template.

With a Chrome extension like [Post to Tumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah?hl=en), I can add, categorize, and tag links I love in seconds. With Tumblr's RSS and API, I can make my links appear anywhere I want.

To make my bookmarks social, I plan to use the tumblr API to display my bookmarks on my site, so visitors will know the type of content I'm interested in ([Here's a quick how-to](/blog/2016/08/tumblr_integration.html)). I can even add my own comments, thoughts, and treat my bookmarks as reposts.

I already use the [Panda](http://usepanda.com) Chrome plugin to display news and RSS feeds, so I can keep my bookmarks fresh in my mind by adding my own Tumblr feed to Panda.

This way, whenever I start Chrome, I can get a quick glance at the recent bookmarks I've added.

Neat eh?
