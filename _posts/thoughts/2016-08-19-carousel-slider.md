## Carousels 


Lots of hate on carousels
Research shows it doesn't work
Designers (like me) don't like to use them
We can't make people click
Hides lots of information

basically, a lot of things bad about sliders


BUT there's one thing sliders are good at, the same thing that makes it bad: it hides things.
It hides the things you don't need people to see (because it's large, because it's distressing, or annoying, or even just off topic), but can provide it there for people to access. It's the perfect side room


It travels around and around, back home again, to a place we know were were loved â€“ Don Draper
