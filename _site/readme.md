This is the template for my personal portfolio and resume. Feel free to build off of it.

**NOTE:** Caveat forker. This code is very outdated. It still uses RedCloth Textile instead of Markdown, and needs an overhaul. You have been warned.

This code is built on, but heavily edited from Nathan [McGinness's repo]:https://github.com/njmcgee/njmcgee.github.com
