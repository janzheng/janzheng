h2. tl;dr

I've always had a fascination with learning, doing, and experimenting, and my experiences span across psychology, user research, design, and coding. I frequently use Sketch, Axure, Adobe, and other design and productivity tools. After quickly defining an approach, I prefer to create tangible examples by prototyping them in HTML, JavaScript and SASS/CSS. I am also familiar with anything from C to Processing.

My eclectic background mirrors my eclectic upbringing. Though born in China, I moved to Stockholm at a young age. I am fluent in English and Swedish, and am conversational in Mandarin.

I hold dual citizenship with both the United States and Sweden, which means that I could easily work in and out of the U.S. and countries within the European Union.

On my off days, I enjoy swing dancing, circusing, rock climbing, playing indie games, and cooking / stuffing my face with tasty foods.

h2. About This Site

For the second round of redesign, I wanted to reduce the number of artifacts on the page, like shapes and outlines, and take a more typographic, minimalist approach. Any shapes and lines are only used to accentuate the information I'm presenting, with enough white space to prevent clutter.

This site is now my umpteen+1th portfolio design, but every iteration has seen improvement. The site is built on the static site generator "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll and is hosted completely for free on "Github Pages":https://github.com/janzheng/janzheng.github.com.

The front-end styling was written in SASS, with the help of "bourbon.io":http://bourbon.io/ and "Neat":neat.bourbon.io.

Icons are sourced from "IconMonstr":http://iconmonstr.com/ and <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title="Flaticon">Flaticon.com</a>

Cheers, 
Jan
