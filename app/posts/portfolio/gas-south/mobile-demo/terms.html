      <h1>Residential Terms and Conditions of Service</h1>
      <div class="center">
        <strong>GAS SOUTH, LLC</strong>
        <div>Residential Terms and Conditions of Service</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        These “Terms and Conditions of Service,” together with the Disclosure Statement and confirmation notice, represent a complete statement of the agreement between Gas South, LLC (“Gas South”) and you, the customer. Gas South’s plans may vary by pricing, length of commitment, and promotional incentives. Gas South’s plans include the prices and charges that a customer pays for the natural gas commodity Gas South sells. The Georgia Public Service Commission (“GPSC”) separately regulates distribution charges for the delivery of natural gas to the customer by Atlanta Gas Light Company (“AGL”). The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates interstate transportation prices and services.

      <p class="bold">
        Special Notice of Customer Rights: These “Terms and Conditions of Service” are subject to the Natural Gas Consumers Relief Act as implemented by the GPSC and other laws and regulations applicable to natural gas marketers certificated by the GPSC. Gas South will only apply these terms in a fashion consistent with those laws and regulations, including limitations on customer fees and deposits and provisions for the return of deposits. In addition, customers may utilize Gas South's dispute resolution process required by the GPSC pursuant to its implementation of the Natural Gas Consumers Relief Act.

      <p>
        <strong>Length of Commitment:</strong>  The length of your commitment to purchase gas and any renewal options you may have vary depending on the plan you select. Similarly, Gas South’s commitment to the price of the gas and any renewal options Gas South may offer may vary depending on the plan you select. The Disclosure Statement and confirmation notice that is included as a part of these Terms and Conditions details the terms of your plan, including your rate per therm and length of service. Your purchases from Gas South will begin on the meter reading date determined by AGL.

      <p>
        (a) If you are turning on natural gas service for the first time in a new location or after a seasonal (or other) disconnection, your agreement with Gas South becomes effective on the date when service is turned on by AGL.

      <p>
        (b) If you are switching to Gas South from another marketer in Georgia, and if you sign up by the 15th day of a given month, your switch will typically become effective on the 1st day of the next month. If you enroll after the 15th day of the month, your switch may not become effective until the following month (example: sign up March 21st, your switch typically will become effective May 1st). Gas South relies on Atlanta Gas Light to process switch requests and delays can occur.

      <p>
        <strong>Basic Service Pricing:</strong>  Under a fixed rate contract, Gas South will charge you a rate per therm for natural gas commodity service that will not change for the term of your contract. Under a variable rate contract, Gas South will charge you a rate per therm for natural gas commodity service that may change monthly based on market conditions. Pricing plans may vary with such factors as your credit and incentive packages that Gas South offers. AGL delivery base charges and meter read fee, a Gas South monthly customer service fee, and state and local taxes will be charged in addition to your rate per therm. Rates and customer service fees may also change for any renewal periods as stated in the applicable renewal offer. Gas South will not assess new or additional customer service fees or other charges or fees if you are on a variable rate plan without providing you advance written notice of those charges or additions at least twenty-five (25) days prior to implementation of the charge or fee.

      <p>
        <strong>Payment:</strong> Payment in full is due on or before the due date shown on your bill. Below are the payment options:
        <ul class="tc_ul">
          <li><strong>Mail:</strong> Payments can be made by check or money order to PO Box 4298 Atlanta, GA 30302. Please allow five (5) days for mail delivery of payment.</li>

        </ul>

      <p>
        Gas South reserves the right to add, change or terminate payment options at any time.  

      <p>
        <strong>Quantity Delivered:</strong>  Gas South sells only the quantity of gas delivered to your AGL gas meter as determined by AGL. Gas South’s obligation to sell a quantity of gas will be limited to your historic gas usage and patterns of use with reasonable variances. Gas South will use reasonable efforts to adjust deliveries if your usage changes.

      <p>
        <strong>Change of Address:</strong>  When you enroll to purchase natural gas from Gas South, you are agreeing to purchase gas from Gas South for a particular location. If you move to another location, you will need to enroll separately for the new location.

      <p>
        <strong>Right to Cancel:</strong>  You will have the right to cancel gas purchases from Gas South at any time. To cancel your service with Gas South, call 1-866-762-6427 (toll- free). A $150 early contract cancellation fee applies to fixed rate plans, if you choose to terminate your fixed rate contract before it expires. Your bill will also include Atlanta Gas Light charges and state and local taxes. Gas South will not charge a cancellation fee if you qualify as a low-income residential customer seeking service for the first time from the regulated provider, if you terminate service to relocate to another residence and do not change marketers, or if you are relocating outside the Atlanta Gas Light territory. You have the right to switch once a year without incurring AGL’s switching charge of $7.50. Switching and any additional charges assessed by AGL may be charged to you.  

      <p>
        <strong>Changes to Terms and Conditions:</strong>  Gas South may change the plans and terms and conditions of its sales to you. If you are on a fixed term agreement with Gas South and the expiration date of such agreement is approaching or whenever Gas South proposes to change its terms of service under any type of agreement, Gas South will provide you written notice of changes before they are effective. The notice will describe the changes in the terms and conditions and explain your options in response to the changes. If changes in law or GPSC orders and rules require a change in the way Gas South sells gas to you, Gas South will make the required change, and Gas South will continue to sell gas to you under the plan in which you are enrolled. If Gas South initiates a change in your plan, you will have the option of changing your marketer and we will inform you of that option when it applies.

      <p>
        <strong>Limitation of Warranty:</strong>  Gas South is selling you a commodity that is produced, stored and transported by other businesses. Gas South makes no representations or warranties other than those expressly stated in these terms and conditions. Gas South expressly disclaims all other warranties, express or implied, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The natural gas that Gas South markets will meet applicable industry quality standards. Gas South is not responsible for the delivery of gas to your premises. Gas South is undertaking no obligations, responsibilities or liabilities upon and after delivery of the natural gas to AGL at the delivery point. Gas South is not responsible for your use of the natural gas. Gas South exercises no independent control over AGL’s facilities necessary for delivery of the natural gas, and Gas South undertakes no responsibility or liability for the operations of AGL or for interruptions, termination or deterioration of its delivery or other services due to actions by AGL or others. Gas South undertakes no responsibility for other pipeline or storage operations or resulting interruption of upstream transportation that is scheduled as firm that prevents the delivery of natural gas to the delivery point.

      <p>
        <strong>Governing Law:</strong>  Gas South’s sales to you will be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, including the laws applying to the sale of goods and the applicable provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by the State of Georgia.

        <strong>Right of Rescission:</strong> A consumer shall have a three-day right of rescission following receipt of this disclosure at the time of initiating service or when informed of a change in terms or conditions.  You, the consumer, may cancel in writing or electronically by contacting the marketer.

      <p>
        <strong>Notice of Expiration or Changes:</strong> If you have a fixed term contract with us and it is approaching the expiration date, or whenever we propose to change our terms of service in any type of agreement, you will receive written notification from us prior to the date of expiration of or change to the agreement.  We will explain your options to you in this advance notification.

      <p>
        <strong>Credit Policy:</strong> Gas South typically performs a credit check on all customers enrolling or renewing for service. Your credit score may influence your customer service fee, rate plan, and deposit. A recent twelve (12) month payment history from another utility (electricity, telephone, or gas) may also be required to obtain service. If you are requested to provide payment history or service is declined, Gas South will send you a letter explaining the reason for the decision. 

      <p>
        <strong>Deposits:</strong> Gas South may require a deposit for service depending on your credit score and payment history if you primarily use gas for personal, family, or household purposes. Deposits shall not exceed $150.00 for a residential customer. If a deposit is required from you and you have paid your Gas South bills on time as indicated on your monthly billing statement for a period of six (6) months or if you terminate the account, whichever comes first, Gas South will refund the deposit to you within sixty (60) days. Deposits will not be refunded if you have an outstanding balance or an overdue balance exceeding the amount of the deposit. If the outstanding or overdue balance is less than the deposit, Gas South will refund the difference.  

      <p>
        <strong>Cancellation Fee:</strong> A $150 early contract cancellation fee applies to fixed rate plans, if you choose to terminate your fixed rate contract before it expires. Gas South does not charge a cancellation fee for variable rate contracts. You have the right to switch once a year without incurring AGL’s switching charge of $7.50. Additional switching charges assessed by AGL may be passed on to you, the customer.

Gas South will deliver a written notice of the proposed disconnection at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of disconnection. Before a request is made to AGL to disconnect gas service for failure to pay, Gas South will offer at least one (1) reasonable pay arrangement in writing. Gas service will not be disconnected by Gas South if it is not your current marketer or for nonpayment of a bill that was not sent to you in a timely manner or for any portions of a bill resulting from a billing dispute.
