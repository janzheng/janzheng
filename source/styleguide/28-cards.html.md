# Cards

`_cards.scss`

Cards are floating information boxes, similar to what is used on Google's material design, though without the strict usage rules. These are made to stand out, and a box-shadow effect makes them feel like they "pop" out of the screen.

Use these to draw attention to a box of special information, maybe even concluded with a call-to-action.

    <h3>Interesting Topic</h3>
    <div class="_padding-bottom"><i class="fa fa-bolt fa-2x"></i></div>
    <p class="_padding-none">This is fairly interesting to talk about. Hey look, there's a bolt. It's Harry Potter's icon! Or is it?
    </p>

    <p>Ready to check it out?</p>
