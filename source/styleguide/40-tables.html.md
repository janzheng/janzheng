# Tables

Tables are often that elephant in the room. They're big, unwieldy, messy. Sometimes they're too heavy and convey too much data. But many times they're more than necessary, and they can be the only way to effectively show data.

Though they're sometimes the "lazy way out" in designing for visualizing data, they're quick and a decades-year old design pattern.
