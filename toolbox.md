As time goes, I will drop more desktop, web and mobile apps, websites, testing suites, design software, diagramming tools, developer frameworks, books and other resources into this spot. 

I'm still trying to figure out the best way to present this information, so while you wait, try to picture a little stick guy (or stick gal) digging a hole with a shovel, with the words "work in progress" or "under construction" by his (or her) side.
